## Project Description
This repository contains my independent work on the assignments from the book FPGA Prototyping Examples with SystemVerilog by Pong P. Chu. These projects do not come with provided solutions, so the work here reflects my own efforts and understanding.

This repository serves as a way to track my progress and share my work with other students interested in completing these projects. By sharing our work, we can compare solutions and identify areas for improvement.
